<h3>Using KefEdit's web interface:</h3>
<p>KefEdit comes with a useful web interface that can be used to
transport kef files to and from IRIS/PASSCAL's servers or any other
server with compatable API. To view the interface, click the tab
labeled "Client Interface" in the upper left corner of the screen.</p>

<p>Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the interface.</p>

<b>1) Logging in</b>
<p>By default, KefEdit will attempt to connect to an IRIS/Passcal server
named Jasper. If you want to login to a different server, modify the
login credentials as pictured.</p>

<p>After the login information is set, you are ready to connect.
Click the login button to get started.</p>

<p><b>2) Getting connected</b></p>

<p><img src="./images/interfaceconnectdemo.png">
<p>Click the Login button and you should see a login confirmation.
If you see an error instead, make sure your credentials are correct.</p> 
<p>If you still receive an error, make sure
the server you are trying to connect to is online and serving the 
correct API on port 50007.</p>

<p><b>3) Sending commands</b></p>
<p>KefEdit's inteface attempts to facilitate the process of
  transfer. Most of the commands needed to carry out transfers are
  automatically tied to the commands dropdown. Click the commands
  dropdown arrow to see all the commands avalable.</p>
<p>After selecting a commmand, pushing the button next to the drop
  down menu will initiate the command. If you would like to send
  commands manually, you may use the commandline located above the
  send button. Type "commands" to see a list of commands.</p>

<p><b>4) Selecting an experiment</b></p>
<p>After logging in, you must first select an experiment. To see what
  experiments you have available to you, run "Get Experiments" from
  the command drop down. To select an experiment, run "Select
  Experiment" and type the Experiment's name. You should receive a
  confirmation message from the server.</p>

<p><b>5) Downloading</b></p>
<p>KefEdit's interface allows you to download any kef file generated
  from the experiment or the master.ph5 file. To download one of
  these files, run the download command from the command drop
  down. From here you can select the file to download and save on
  your machine</p>
<p><b>6) Uploading Kefs</b></p>
<p>If you would like to commit your changes to an experiment, you
  must first have a kef file generated from KefEdit's editor. Run the
  upoad command from the commands menu and select the kef or other
  file you would like to have the server execute.</p>
<p>If you would like the server to commit your changes, type
  "execute" in the command line and send it to instruct the server to
  execute your selected file. If you would like to execute multiple
  files, please run execute after every upload. If you would like to
  select a file for execution, send "file filename" where filename is
  the name of the file on the server you would like executed.</p>
