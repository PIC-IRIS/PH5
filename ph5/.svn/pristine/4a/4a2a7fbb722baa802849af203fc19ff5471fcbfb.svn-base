<h3>I. Obtaining Kef Files:</h3>
<p>If you already have your kef files saved on your local machine,
  you may skip to Section II. If you are unfirmiliar with the web
  interface, see <a href="./interface.html">Using the Web
  Interface</a></p>
<p>Open the interface tab and log into the web interface and select
 an experiment to pull kef files from. Run the download command and
 choose a kef file to download and save.
</p>

<h3>II. Viewing Kef files:</h3>
<p>To get started, make sure you are in the "Editor" tab. Click the
  File dropdown arrow in the menubar and select "Open". From here you
  may show KefEdit which file to open.</p>

<p>Your kef file should now be displayed! If you run into a problem,
  see Apendix A.</p>

<h3>III. Editing Kef Files</h3>
<p>As of the Alpha version, there are two ways to make edits to kef
  files. You can manually make entry changes by double clicking cells
  and making changes that way or you can use the builtin REGEX engine.
<p>The REGEX engine is for those that know regular expressions and
  would like to make changes that way. The regular expressions engine
  works on a by column basis. Usage works as follows:
  <p>COLUMN_NAME "regular expression" changes
<p>The engine will replace any value within the matched COLUMN_NAME
  that matches the "regular expression" (The regular expression must
  be in quotes which will not be evaluated as part of the expression)
  and replace the value with changes. An Example: 
</p>
<p><img src="./images/rebefore.png"></p>
<p>Clicking "Go" will change all integers under event_id_s to 5031</p>

<h3>IV. Marking Cells</h3>
<p>After you have made your changes, you must mark the rows you would
  like updated or deleted on the experiment. To mark cells for Update,
  highlight one or all cells from all the rows you want updated and
  click the Edit dropdown in the toolbar. From here you can choose
  mark cells for update or deletion. I will be updating rows 1 and 2
  and deleting row 3.</p>
<p>After you mark the rows you wish to update you must select a key to
  for the server to identify which row to change in the experiment
  data. Highlight the cell you would like to use as the key for the
  row and click the Edit dropdown to run select your key. Try to pick
  keys that are Unique. I will only be selecting 3 keys.</p>
<p><img src="./images/highlights.png">
<p>You can clearly see the rows to be updated (marked green), the rows
  to be deleted (marked red), and the keys (marked gold).</p>

<h3>V. Saving Kef Files</h3>
<p>Once you have made all your changes, you may save your kef
  file. Click the file dropdown and select Save As and name your
  file. I will name mine out.kef.</p>
<p><img src="./images/save.png">
<p>Looking at the output you can clearly see that the three rows I
  marked are marked for update and my out.kef file is ready to be sent
  off to the server.</p>
<p><img src="./images/out.png">
<p>Because of the way .kef files work, it is unwise to mark any kef
file that contains existing Update/Delete information 
(the editor automatically detects files with existing information).
This can cause serious errors if sent off via the interface.</p>

<h3>Apendix A: Troubleshooting and Warning Messages</h3>
<b>1. File: "filename" is not a Kef File! Parse Failed!</b>
<p>KefEdit is only capable of reading .kef files. Though you may
  select any file you want for opening, if the file does not end with
  some form of .kef (capitalization does not matter), the file will
  not open (even if the file matches .kef syntax perfectly).
<p><b>2. Syntax error on line X</b>
<p>.kef files are structured in a way such that KefEdit can read
  them. If KefEdit runs into syntax it does not understand, it throws
  this error. This can be helpful for finding any errors in the
  files. Note: KefEdit can only detect syntax errors at the beginning
  of lines and cannot detect errors in tablenames or values.
